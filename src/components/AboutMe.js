				<p className="intro"> 
					I'm Nasita, a user interface designer with web development experience. 
				</p>
				<p className="body"> 
					My background in web development has taught me to prioritze the users needs and create simple solutions through a design thinking mentality. 
					As a result, I learned about the importance of creating practical designs through a coding perspective which is a valuable asset in creating future designs. Iâ€™ve always focused on the user through technology which is why I want to focus my passion on bringing people a better technological experience through an empathic and human approach.
